This digital painting is one of my first original artworks. I made this when I was back home in India. While I lived in Mumbai, a sight like this would be unusual because we don't have enough trees in the city. However, when I first moved to Eugene and experienced the Autumn season, it was surreal. One moment you have trees full of red leaves, and the next thing you know, leaves cover the whole ground.

Anyway, back to the painting, I made this one in Adobe Photoshop with a mouse instead of a graphic tablet. I used a soft brush to create the branches and background, and a custom leaves brush to create the foliage. A quick search of Autumn on the interweb gave me the necessary inspiration and reference. FYI, there was supposed to be a bench in front of the tree; however, I was not too fond of it after various iterations. Finally, I love the way the ground looks. It looks like it was painted in the 1800s.
